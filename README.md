# Sales In A Cloud

SaaS Platform connecting businesses with individual contractors available for hire,
to sell their products and services. Allows companies to hire remote sales and representation 
with great flexibility in terms of price model, and businesses can choose whether to pay
per meeting (Microsoft Teams integration), per number of calls made, per hour, 
per project or event such as conventionsa and conferences.

Allows employers registered with the platform to create ad-hoc sales teams in the cloud,
and people signing-up as employees are provided with an opportunity to try sales if they have 
no previous experience. For an employee with previous experience in sales, the platform quickly 
becomes the center of the employee's work station, focusing on facilitating communication 
(work e-mail,teams integration,internal private/team chat) planning (receive assignments, 
create tasks and book meetings in the calendar), automatic reporting (auto-transcription and optional recordings
of all meetings through microsoft teams integration, simple app with open source, for logging call 
activity and optional recordings with the platform, and detailed activity logs in the platform) ,
handles payments from employers. Employers have to pay a subscription fee, either monthly or annually,
this fee is for access to the platform and all the contractors. In order to start hiring people or paying
for assigments/tasks, the platform requires that the funds are secured in advance, and each employer tops-up
a "payroll" balance, from which funds are distributed to employee's upon completion of assignments or meetings. 

Employers may also offer commission to employees. should an engagement initiated by an approved contractor, lead to a deal
and a contract is signed. Whenever a contractor lands a deal, the total value of the deal in revenue for the employer, is added to the sum of the contractor's "net worth", displayed on their public profile/porfolio page, along with a bunch
of different scores, previous engegement's and work experience, and reviews/quotes/references written by customers and employer. The platform encourages customers taking part in meetings booked by a registered sales representative, to separate product/service from the sales person, any comments or questions on products/services that the sales representative can't answer is forwarded to the owning company. The platform however, seeks to encourage people to always improve and grow more adept and secure, rather than complacent and safe, to achieve this we plan to use AI to analyze carefully selected data points as well as work flows and statistics in order to provide personal suggestions for each registered employee (as well as automating notes, tips, tasks and power-point presentations, and also suggestions for employers on how to get the most out of the platform and  increase their sales   and to get the most valuable and most constructive points from notes and reviews. from the point of view of sales, 

The platform also provides a system for handling disputes between employer and employee's to aid in preserving 
long-lasting, professional and mututally beneficial relationship. 
It will also feature some integration with power-point or file-share so the employer and employee can 
share materials for sales meetings, conventions etc, graphics like company logos for branding 
documents, and also so that the employee's can make their own power-points or upload different calculations,statistics, notes
or anything related to a lead or a prospect, or the employing company.
