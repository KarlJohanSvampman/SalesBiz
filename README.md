# Sales In A Cloud - Creating Business Incentive

## Business Concept
SaaS Platform connecting businesses with individual contractors available for hire,
to sell their products and services. Allows companies to hire remote sales and representation 
with great flexibility in terms of price model, and businesses can choose whether to pay
per meeting (Microsoft Teams integration), per number of calls made, per hour, 
per project or event such as conventionsa and conferences.

## Vision
Our slogan is "Creating Business Incentive", a phrase that pretty accurately sums up what is our vision,
namely to generate business by discovering untapped resources in the form of talent, in the art of sales.
The more successful businessmen throghout history became bankers in the end, but the way we see it, they all 
started out as salesmen, brokering deals in between business, and investing their profits wherever they saw opportunity
in the form of innovation, residing within people. 

In other words, to invest in people may not be considered as risk-free 
as, let's say investing in real estate, and far from everyone is cut out to do sales, however, investing in
people is still interesting because , ignoring the risks, it is the single most potentially profitable 
prospect, as there is no limit to how much a single person who is not limited to a box and who has a unique perspective, 
can sell,

## Features & Selling Points

and make use of contractors all over the world, with proficiency and experience in various 
languages, cultures and markets. In our modern, connected world of global capitalism, 
business is everywhere, all at once, and often the result of random meetings, meaning people being 
connected by random chance. Expand your network of contacts and unlock opportunited to expand your business!

### Encourages ordinary people to sign-up as employees and to try working in sales, with litte or no exoerience. 

### Becomes the center of each contractor's work station, focusing on facilitating sales
through communication (work e-mail,teams integration,internal private/team chat) planning (receive assignments, 
create tasks and book meetings in the calendar), automatic reporting (auto-transcription and optional recordings
of all meetings through microsoft teams integration, simple app with open source, for logging call 
activity and optional recordings with the platform, and detailed activity logs in the platform) ,
handles payments from employers. 

### Employers (Vendors) pay a subscription fee, either monthly or annually,
this fee is for access to the platform and all the contractors. In order to start hiring people or paying
for assigments/tasks, the platform requires that the funds are secured in advance, and each employer tops-up
a "payroll" balance, from which funds are distributed to employee's upon completion of assignments or meetings. 

### Employers may offer commission to employees. should an engagement initiated by an approved contractor, lead to a deal
and a contract is signed. The remaining part of the process, up to and including the point where a contract is signed, happens outside of the "Sales In A Cloud", however the platform will follow-up with the company to ensure that the final value of the deal is communicated, and that the contractor receives any commision stated in the contracted agreeement between employer and employing vendor company. 
Whenever a contractor lands a deal, the total value of the deal in revenue for the employer, is added to the sum of the contractor's "net worth", displayed on their public profile/porfolio page, along with a bunch
of different scores, previous engegement's and work experience, and reviews/quotes/references written by customers and employer. 

### The platform encourages anyone taking part in meetings booked by a registered sales representative, to separate product/service from the sales person, any comments or questions on products/services that the sales representative can't answer is forwarded to the owning company. The employer provides educational materials for potential hires to study in order to take an "exam", whenever the contractor feels he/she is sufficiently prepared, they request a review by the product/service owner of the product/service, in the form of a teams meeting , together with representative's for the employing company. Once approved, the contractor is allowed to start looking for buyers, and gets access to whatever material the vendor supplied to help them identify potential customers and companies or industries of interest 
An approved sales representative is also authorized to request information from the employer, relating to a lead and a prospect, and to request evaluation of leads, price estimates and quotes based on wishes expressed by the customer. 

The platform however, seeks to encourage people to always improve and grow more adept and secure, rather than complacent and safe, to achieve this we plan to use AI to analyze carefully selected data points as well as work flows and statistics in order to provide personal suggestions for each registered employee (as well as automating notes, tips, tasks and power-point presentations, and also suggestions for employers on how to get the most out of the platform and  increase their sales and to get the most valuable and most constructive points from notes and reviews. from the point of view of sales.

### The platform also provides a system for handling disputes between employer and employee's to aid in preserving long-lasting, professional and mututally beneficial relationship. 
It will also feature some integration with power-point or file-share so the employer and employee can share materials for sales meetings, conventions etc, graphics like company logos for branding 
documents, and also so that the employee's can make their own power-points or upload different calculations,statistics, notesor anything related to a lead or a prospect, or the employing company.
